commit-now it does remember us when we close the browser--> with no error in the navigation bar,  but what the problem is
 if you didnot applied the remember me (ie when you didnot clicked on it),it will give an error that undefined 
variable ->isvalid 


but when we logout after opening the browser(as it remembers us and we are automatically loged in),
 therere is an error in the navigation bar (after logout we are directed to the index page,)--->now when the header 
is included in the index page it does not recognise the isvalid --->because it is not on the right place of return..
....
see next commit
